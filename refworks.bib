  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews research in three important areas concerning robot swarms: communication, diversity, and learning. Communication (or the lack of it) is a key design consideration for robot teams. Communication can enable certain types of coordination that would be impossible otherwise. However communication can also add unnecessary cost and complexity. Important research issues regarding communication concern what should be communicated, over what range, and when the communication should occur. We also consider how diverse behaviors might help or hinder a team, and how to measure diversity in the first place. Finally, we show how learning can provide a powerful means for enabling a team to master a task or adapt to changing conditions. We hypothesize that these three topics are critically interrelated in the context of learning swarms, and we suggest research directions to explore them.},

  Abstract                 = {While techniques exist for simulating swarming behaviors, these methods usually provide only simplistic navigation and planning capabilities. In this review, we explore the benefits of integrating roadmap-based path planning methods with flocking techniques to achieve different behaviors. We show how group behaviors such as exploring can be facilitated by using dynamic roadmaps (e.g., modifying edge weights) as an implicit means of communication between flock members. Extending ideas from cognitive modeling, we embed behavior rules in individual flock members and in the roadmap. These behavior rules enable the flock members to modify their actions based on their current location and state. We propose new techniques for several distinct group behaviors: homing, exploring (covering and goal searching), passing through narrow areas and shepherding. We present results that show that our methods provide significant improvement over methods that utilize purely local knowledge and moreover, that we achieve performance approaching that which could be obtained by an ideal method that has complete global knowledge. Animations of these behaviors can be viewed on our webpages.},

The conditions turn out to be not much more stringent than for linear, one-step, stationary iterative schemes, either synchronous or sequential. The rate of convergence is also comparable. The main result is that swarms converge in cases when synchronous and/or sequential updating systems do not. The other significant result is that swarms can undergo a transition from non convergence to convergence as their degree of partial synchronicity diminishes, i.e., as they get more “disordered”. The production of order by disordered action appears as a basic characteristic of swarms.},

With distributed task allocation as a case study, we show how optimal control parameters leading to a desired steady-state task distribution for two fully-distributed algorithms can be found even if the parameters of the system are unknown. First, a reactive algorithm in which robots change states independently from each other and which leads to a linear macroscopic model describing the dynamics of the system is considered. Second, a threshold-based algorithm where robots change states based on the number of other robots in this state and which leads to a non-linear model is investigated. Whereas analytical results can be obtained for the linear system, the opti- mization of the non-linear controller is performed numerically. Finally, we show using stochastic simulations that whereas the presented methodology and models work best if the swarm size is large, useful results can already be obtained for team-sizes below a hundred robots. The methodology presented can be applied to scenarios involving the control of large numbers of entities with limited computational and communication abilities as well as a tight energy budget, such as swarms of robots from the centimeter to nanometer range or sensor networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Vision-based tracking is used in nearly all robotic laboratories for monitoring and extracting of agent positions, orientations, and trajectories. However, there is currently no accepted standard software solution available, so many research groups resort to developing and using their own custom software. In this paper, we present version 4 of SwisTrack, an open source project for simultaneous tracking of multiple agents. While its broad range of pre-implemented algorithmic components allows it to be used in a variety of experimental applications, its novelty stands in its highly modular architecture. Advanced users can therefore also implement additional customized modules which extend the functionality of the existing components within the provided interface. This paper introduces SwisTrack and shows experiments with both marked and marker-less agents.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this work is to enable an array of mobile sensors to autonomously arrange themselves into a regularly spaced lattice formation such that they may collectively be used as an effective phased-array sensor. Existing approaches to this problem encounter issues with local minima which allow the formation of lattice patterns that are locally regular but have discontinuities or defects that would be undesirable in a narrow-band beamforming application. By exploiting a common reference orientation, such as might be obtained from a magnetic compass, we have been able to create control laws that operate on orthogonal axes and thereby minimize the occurrence of local minima. The result is that we can now form lattice patterns with greater uniformity over extended distances, with significantly less energy or movement per robot. Despite the need for a shared directional reference, our methods are also robust to significant error in the reference readings.},

  Abstract                 = {This review paper sets out to explore the question of how future complex engineered systems based upon the swarm intelligence paradigm could be assured for dependability. The paper introduces the new concept of ‘swarm engineering’: a fusion of dependable systems engineering and swarm intelligence. The paper reviews the disciplines and processes conventionally employed to assure the dependability of conventional complex (and safety critical) systems in the light of swarm intelligence research and in so doing tries to map processes of analysis, design and test for safety-critical systems against relevant research in swarm intelligence. A case study of a swarm robotic system is used to illustrate this mapping. The paper concludes that while some of the tools needed to assure a swarm for dependability exist, many do not, and hence much work needs to be done before dependable swarms become a reality.},
