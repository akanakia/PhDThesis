	swarms: communication, diversity, and learning. Communication (or
	the lack of it) is a key design consideration for robot teams. Communication
	can enable certain types of coordination that would be impossible
	otherwise. However communication can also add unnecessary cost and
	complexity. Important research issues regarding communication concern
	what should be communicated, over what range, and when the communication
	should occur. We also consider how diverse behaviors might help or
	hinder a team, and how to measure diversity in the first place. Finally,
	we show how learning can provide a powerful means for enabling a
	team to master a task or adapt to changing conditions. We hypothesize
	that these three topics are critically interrelated in the context
	of learning swarms, and we suggest research directions to explore
	them.},

  abstract = {While techniques exist for simulating swarming behaviors, these methods
	usually provide only simplistic navigation and planning capabilities.
	In this review, we explore the benefits of integrating roadmap-based
	path planning methods with flocking techniques to achieve different
	behaviors. We show how group behaviors such as exploring can be facilitated
	by using dynamic roadmaps (e.g., modifying edge weights) as an implicit
	means of communication between flock members. Extending ideas from
	cognitive modeling, we embed behavior rules in individual flock members
	and in the roadmap. These behavior rules enable the flock members
	to modify their actions based on their current location and state.
	We propose new techniques for several distinct group behaviors: homing,
	exploring (covering and goal searching), passing through narrow areas
	and shepherding. We present results that show that our methods provide
	significant improvement over methods that utilize purely local knowledge
	and moreover, that we achieve performance approaching that which
	could be obtained by an ideal method that has complete global knowledge.
	Animations of these behaviors can be viewed on our webpages.},

	look at the conditions for their convergence to a fixed point. The
	conditions turn out to be not much more stringent than for linear,
	one-step, stationary iterative schemes, either synchronous or sequential.
	The rate of convergence is also comparable. The main result is that
	swarms converge in cases when synchronous and/or sequential updating
	systems do not. The other significant result is that swarms can undergo
	a transition from non convergence to convergence as their degree
	of partial synchronicity diminishes, i.e., as they get more “disordered”.
	The production of order by disordered action appears as a basic characteristic
	of swarms.},

	project sponsored by the Future and Emerging Technologies program
	of the European Commission. The paper illustrates the goals of the
	project, the robot prototype and the {3D} simulator we built. It
	also reports on the results of experimental work in which distributed
	adaptive controllers are used to control a group of real, or simulated,
	robots so that they perform a variety of tasks which require cooperation
	and coordination.},

	monitoring and extracting of agent positions, orientations, and trajectories.
	However, there is currently no accepted standard software solution
	available, so many research groups resort to developing and using
	their own custom software. In this paper, we present version 4 of
	SwisTrack, an open source project for simultaneous tracking of multiple
	agents. While its broad range of pre-implemented algorithmic components
	allows it to be used in a variety of experimental applications, its
	novelty stands in its highly modular architecture. Advanced users
	can therefore also implement additional customized modules which
	extend the functionality of the existing components within the provided
	interface. This paper introduces SwisTrack and shows experiments
	with both marked and marker-less agents.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work is to enable an array of mobile sensors to
	autonomously arrange themselves into a regularly spaced lattice formation
	such that they may collectively be used as an effective phased-array
	sensor. Existing approaches to this problem encounter issues with
	local minima which allow the formation of lattice patterns that are
	locally regular but have discontinuities or defects that would be
	undesirable in a narrow-band beamforming application. By exploiting
	a common reference orientation, such as might be obtained from a
	magnetic compass, we have been able to create control laws that operate
	on orthogonal axes and thereby minimize the occurrence of local minima.
	The result is that we can now form lattice patterns with greater
	uniformity over extended distances, with significantly less energy
	or movement per robot. Despite the need for a shared directional
	reference, our methods are also robust to significant error in the
	reference readings.},

  abstract = {This review paper sets out to explore the question of how future complex
	engineered systems based upon the swarm intelligence paradigm could
	be assured for dependability. The paper introduces the new concept
	of ‘swarm engineering’: a fusion of dependable systems engineering
	and swarm intelligence. The paper reviews the disciplines and processes
	conventionally employed to assure the dependability of conventional
	complex (and safety critical) systems in the light of swarm intelligence
	research and in so doing tries to map processes of analysis, design
	and test for safety-critical systems against relevant research in
	swarm intelligence. A case study of a swarm robotic system is used
	to illustrate this mapping. The paper concludes that while some of
	the tools needed to assure a swarm for dependability exist, many
	do not, and hence much work needs to be done before dependable swarms
	become a reality.},
